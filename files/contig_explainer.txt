Mapping Catalytic Triad Design Hypotheses to RFdiffusion Contigs
Designing a protein scaffold around a catalytic triad (Ser–His–Asp) involves translating biochemical intuition into contig specifications for RFdiffusion. The contig string 164-164/E210-230/165-165 encodes how a known active-site motif is embedded in a de novo protein. Below, we break down each segment of this contig and explain the rationale grounded in real enzyme design principles. We then discuss how varying the contigs (lengths, positions, and residues) can test different hypotheses and what effects those changes might have in RFdiffusion.

Breakdown of Contig Segments (164-164/E210-230/165-165)
This contig is interpreted by RFdiffusion as follows: build 164 residues, then graft residues 210–230 from chain E of the input structure, then build another 165 residues. In essence, a 21-residue active-site motif (the catalytic triad region) is fixed in the middle, with large N- and C-terminal segments to be designed around it​

164-164 – N-terminal Scaffold Before the Motif
Why 164 residues before the active site? In naturally occurring enzymes, the active site usually lies in an internal pocket or cleft, not at the very end of the polypeptide chain​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Only a handful of residues (often 3–4 in a triad) directly perform catalysis, while hundreds of other amino acids are required to hold those catalytic residues in the correct orientation and stable conformation​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. For example, the serine protease chymotrypsin has a triad (Ser, His, Asp) comprising just 3 amino acids out of ~241; the remainder of the protein forms a robust structure that positions these residues precisely. In general, “to enable that spatial arrangement of amino acids within that small active site, a gigantic scaffolding arrangement around it can be necessary.”​
REDDIT.COM

In the contig, a 164-residue N-terminal segment provides a substantial “front half” of the protein to support the motif. This length isn’t random – it’s informed by protein stability and natural scaffold constraints:

Structural Stability: A polypeptide on the order of 150–200 amino acids can fold into a well-defined domain with a hydrophobic core. By specifying 164 residues before the motif, we ensure there is enough protein mass to form a stable domain that will anchor one side of the active site. Too short a segment and the active site would end up near an exposed terminus, which could flop around or fail to form the necessary pocket. A long N-terminal region gives the diffusion model room to form secondary structure (helices, sheets) that converge to hold the Ser-His-Asp in place from one side. Essentially, this segment acts as a structural foundation for the active site, akin to how real enzymes often have an entire domain preceding the catalytic residues​

​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.

Natural Scaffold Mimicry: The specific number 164 likely reflects the design hypothesis drawn from a template or known enzyme. If the catalytic motif came from an existing enzyme (chain E, residues 210–230 in the input PDB), that enzyme probably had roughly ~200 residues preceding those positions in its sequence. The designers may have determined that 164 residues is the minimum or optimal length to recreate the necessary portion of that enzyme’s fold leading up to the active site. In practice, they might have trimmed non-essential parts of the original enzyme, ending up with 164 as a length that still includes key secondary structures (e.g. beta strands or helices) that buttress the active site. Using a similar length in the contig is a way of saying “build me a domain that plays the same role as the original N-terminal region of the enzyme.” This aligns with real-world enzyme design: one often uses the length and secondary structure content of natural domains as a guideline for how much polypeptide is needed to support a functional site.

Reduced Flexibility at the Active Site: By placing a long segment before the motif, the catalytic residues will be deep in the interior of the designed protein rather than at the surface or terminus. This is important because an active site deep in a protein can form a binding pocket and specific geometry, whereas an active site at the very N-terminus would be solvent-exposed and overly flexible. Natural enzymes almost never have catalytic residues right at an end; they are typically buried in a stable fold or between domains​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Thus, the hypothesis here is that ~164 residues will fold up and “present” residue 210 (likely one of the triad members) in an internal position, ready to interact properly with the others.

In summary, the 164-164 segment encodes “make a sizeable N-terminal domain so that the motif isn’t floating at the start.” This choice is informed by the knowledge that large scaffolds are needed to hold a few active residues in the correct arrangement​
REDDIT.COM
, as seen in essentially all real enzymes.

E210-230 – Fixed Catalytic Triad Motif Region
This middle segment is the heart of the design: it specifies that residues 210–230 from chain E of the input structure are to be inserted exactly (with no changes in backbone) into the new design. In other words, the 21-residue fragment containing the catalytic triad is “fixed” in place as the motif. RFdiffusion will scaffold around this fragment without altering it​
GITHUB.COM
. The rationale for fixing the active-site region (as opposed to designing it freely) comes down to conservation of function and geometry:

Preserving Catalytic Geometry: The Ser–His–Asp triad must adopt a precise 3D arrangement to carry out catalysis. Typically, the histidine and aspartate (or glutamate in some enzymes) form a hydrogen-bonded pair that together activate the serine nucleophile (“charge-relay” mechanism​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
). Even slight deviations in the distances or angles can disrupt this proton shuttling network and kill enzymatic activity. By grafting an existing active-site loop or region (from a known enzyme or a previously validated design), we lock in the correct geometry of the triad – the serine’s hydroxyl, the histidine’s imidazole, and the aspartate’s carboxylate are positioned exactly as known to be productive. This segment likely comes from a PDB where those residues were observed forming a functional active site. Freezing 210–230 ensures RFdiffusion does not “wiggle” these key residues out of alignment. In practical terms, the design hypothesis is that “if we keep the triad exactly as nature had it, we have a much better chance of the final protein being catalytic.” This is a standard trick in enzyme design: start from a proven motif so you’re not redesigning the chemistry from scratch​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
.

Evolutionary Conservation: Catalytic residues and their immediate neighbors tend to be highly conserved through evolution​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. Enzymes that share a mechanism will often have very similar sequences and conformations for the triad and the loops that support it. For example, many hydrolases in the α/β-hydrolase fold have a consensus motif around the catalytic serine (like a nucleophile elbow GGX**S**XG) and a similarly placed His–Asp dyad​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. These motifs are conserved because any mutation or structural change in them usually abolishes activity​
REDDIT.COM
. By fixing residues E210-230, the designer is likely capturing not just the three catalytic residues, but also the structural context that evolution found was necessary for them to work (such as a loop conformation that puts the triad in the right orientation, or perhaps part of a beta-sheet that anchors the histidine’s position). The “E” in the contig denotes the chain from the input PDB – it signals RFdiffusion to use those exact coordinates. This suggests those residues are taken from a naturally evolved enzyme or a well-validated design where they are known to function. In short, this segment is defined by functional necessity: it’s the non-negotiable core that must be there for the protein to do chemistry.

Functional Context in 21 Residues: Why use a 21-residue fragment (210–230) and not just the three amino acids of the triad? Because active site residues rarely act alone – the backbone and nearby side chains hold them in position and often participate in catalysis (for example, forming the oxyanion hole or hydrogen-bonding networks). By taking a stretch of 21 residues, the contig likely encompasses an entire loop or small secondary structure element that contains the triad. For example, if Ser and Asp are on the same β-strand or loop, and His is at the end of that loop or on a short helix that follows, one can excise that whole piece as a unit. This ensures that the relative placement of Ser, His, Asp is correct and that any structural elements that stabilize them (like a helix dipole or a Gly that enables a tight turn) are preserved. In a real enzyme, these residues might not be contiguous in the primary sequence, but it’s possible the segment 210–230 was chosen such that it includes all three in one contiguous segment. (It may be that the original enzyme’s numbering was such that these residues ended up adjacent after some processing or it’s an engineered minimal motif.) In any case, the hypothesis is that “this chunk of protein contains the active site chemistry we want,” so we lock it in.

Anchoring the Design: From a design workflow perspective, the E210-230 contig segment acts as an anchor or reference frame for RFdiffusion. The diffusion model will build new structure around it but keep this piece fixed in space​
GITHUB.COM
. This is analogous to how one might do motif grafting by fixing a catalytic loop in Rosetta and designing a new protein around it. The active site thus serves as a seed that the rest of the structure must accommodate. By defining it explicitly, the researcher’s hypothesis about “what the active site should look like” is directly injected into the generation process.

In summary, E210-230 is the catalytic triad motif locked in place. The design hypothesis behind this choice is that those exact residues and conformation are required for function (owing to conservation and mechanistic constraints), so we tell RFdiffusion not to change them, only to scaffold them. This is how a real-world understanding of the triad’s importance translates into the contig string.

165-165 – C-terminal Segment After the Motif
The final part of the contig instructs RFdiffusion to build 165 residues after the fixed motif. This creates a C-terminal domain or region that continues from residue 230 onward. The reasons for having a large segment after the active site are quite similar to those for the N-terminal segment, with some additional considerations:

Embedding the Active Site Internally: Just as we don’t want the motif at the very N-terminus, we also don’t want it at the C-terminus. A **165-residue C-terminal segment ensures the catalytic triad ends up in the interior of the protein chain, not at the end. In a folded structure, this means the triad will likely sit in a pocket or cleft with protein regions on both sides (N and C) forming the walls of the active site. Natural enzymes often have the active site in the inter-domain interface or in the middle of a single domain, with substantial protein on either side. For instance, in many serine hydrolases, there are loops after the catalytic histidine that help form the substrate-binding pocket or cover the active site upon substrate binding. By allowing ~165 residues after the motif, we give the model freedom to create that “back end” of the enzyme – possibly completing any secondary structures that pass through the motif region and providing a cap or lid over the active site as needed.

Structural Integration and Domain Closure: The C-terminal segment will likely fold and pack against the N-terminal segment, encompassing the active site in a stable fold. If the motif fragment (210–230) includes part of a β-strand or helix, the 165-residue segment can contain the continuation of that strand/helix and its neighboring elements, so that the motif is fully integrated into the new protein’s architecture. For example, imagine the 21-residue motif is a loop connecting a beta-strand to an alpha-helix that contains the histidine; the C-terminal part would then carry on from that helix onward. Having a substantial length ensures the model isn’t forced to terminate a secondary structure or leave it dangling. Instead, it can form a complete domain that naturally extends beyond the active site. This often leads to a more realistic, stable protein. In real enzymes, regions following the active site residues often form important stabilizing interactions – they might harbor a helix that shields the active site or a strand that pairs with an N-terminal strand, etc. The 165-length contig is meant to allow those kinds of features to emerge.

Creating the Rest of the Active-Site Pocket: Functionally, the residues after the motif may contribute to substrate binding and specificity. The hypothesis might be that certain structural elements (loops or beta-hairpins) after residue 230 are needed to form a proper substrate pocket or an oxyanion hole. Since those are not included in the fixed motif, we rely on designing them in the C-terminal segment. For instance, in serine proteases, the famous “oxyanion hole” that stabilizes transition states is formed by backbone NH groups just downstream of the catalytic serine. If those weren’t part of the anchored segment, the new C-terminal region must create them. By giving 165 residues, the designer is allowing plenty of room to incorporate such features around the active site. In practical terms, the contig is saying “after the triad, build whatever is needed to complete the enzyme’s active site environment and fold.” Often this involves burying part of the triad in a hydrophobic pocket while leaving the key functional groups accessible in a cavity. Without a C-terminal domain, the active site might be left too exposed or might not form a pocket at all. (Indeed, design tests have shown that if the surrounding scaffold is insufficient, you might end up with catalytic residues just sitting on the surface or conversely being improperly buried​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
.)

Length ~165 rationale: The number 165, like 164, likely comes from either the original enzyme’s architecture or a target size for the designed protein. If the input motif was at positions 210–230, the original protein might have continued to around residue ~375–400 (implying ~145–190 residues after the motif). Choosing 165 could be an average or slightly above the original count to ensure a complete fold. It may also account for the diffusion model’s strengths – RFdiffusion can easily generate single-chain proteins up to a few hundred residues. A total length of ~350 (164 + 21 + 165) is akin to a medium-sized enzyme or even a two-domain enzyme. The designer might have hypothesized that a two-domain or elongated single-domain protein is needed, perhaps to form a deep cleft (one domain on each side of the cleft). In fact, the PDB description for one enzyme (1A4I, an example used in RFdiffusion paper) notes “the enzyme is composed of two α/β domains that assemble to form a wide cleft. The cleft walls are lined with highly conserved residues...”​
RCSB.ORG
 – which is exactly the scenario of two large segments coming together to create an active site cleft. Here, the contig’s N-terminal 164 and C-terminal 165 could be thought of as two halves coming together around the triad.

Protein Flexibility Considerations: Another subtle reason to have a sizable segment after the active site is to provide a “buffer zone” for any induced fit or conformational changes. Enzymatic reactions often involve small motions (loops closing over the substrate, etc.). If the active site were at the very end of the protein, there’d be no support for such motions. A well-designed C-terminal region can include flexible loops or movable elements that can adjust upon substrate binding. As one commentary puts it, enzymes have extra parts in part “to act as buffer zones” for shape changes during catalysis​
REDDIT.COM
. The presence of ~165 residues makes it likely that some of those residues could play such a role (for example, a flap that closes over the active site like in lipases).

In summary, the 165-165 segment reflects the hypothesis that a large C-terminal region is required to complete the enzyme’s structure and functional site. It ensures the catalytic triad is not at the protein’s end but rather enclosed in a sturdy, enzyme-like fold. Both the 164-residue N-term and 165-residue C-term together mimic the fact that “the active site may occupy only 10–20% of the enzyme’s volume, but the rest is necessary to maintain structure and proper orientation”​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. The symmetry of having ~164 on one side and ~165 on the other also suggests the active site is roughly centered, which is a common feature in enzyme domains and likely beneficial for folding (distributing the chain length on both sides for balance).

Recap: The contig 164-164/E210-230/165-165 encodes a design where a 21-residue conserved catalytic motif (Ser-His-Asp) is fixed, with ~164-residue and ~165-residue segments on its N and C termini respectively to form a full protein around it. This setup is directly informed by real-world enzyme architecture: a small active site motif is being scaffolded by large flanking regions​
REDDIT.COM
, just as nature often does. The numbers chosen reflect a combination of the original enzyme’s context and general principles of protein stability and active-site placement.

Exploring Modifications to the Contigs Based on Design Hypotheses
Armed with the baseline contig above, a researcher might try various modifications to test different hypotheses or to address issues that arise in design. Because RFdiffusion allows flexible contig specifications, one can adjust the length and composition of segments to explore how the active site is scaffolded. Below are several ways to modify the contigs and what effects one might expect, always tying back to enzyme design reasoning:

1. Extending the Design Window (Longer Flanking Segments)
Hypothesis: “Perhaps a larger protein scaffold will yield a more stable enzyme or a better active-site pocket.” In this case, a designer might increase the allowed length of the N- and/or C-terminal segments. For example, one could change the contig to something like [200-220/E210-230/200-220], meaning build 200–220 residues on each side of the motif instead of exactly 164/165. This effectively extends the design window, allowing a bigger protein to be generated.

Rationale: Real enzymes sometimes use multiple domains or extra structural elements to optimize activity (e.g., regulatory domains or very large binding clefts). If the initial 164/165 segments result in a protein that is too tight around the active site or not stable enough, a designer might suspect that more residues are needed to form a proper enclosure or to add stability. By extending the flanks, RFdiffusion can attempt to build additional secondary structure or even an extra domain. In practice, this could mean the difference between a shallow pocket and a deep, well-formed pocket for the substrate. Nature often uses larger proteins to create more complex active-site geometries – for instance, some hydrolases have an entire cap domain that closes over the catalytic core. An extended contig could allow the generation of such a cap.

Expected effects in RFdiffusion: With longer segments to diffuse, the model has more degrees of freedom to sample. This can increase diversity of outputs (you might get different topologies – perhaps a two-domain enzyme where the motif lies at the interface, or a single large domain that wraps around). It can also potentially improve the active site environment: more residues can form a more concave pocket around the triad, rather than leaving it exposed. In the RFdiffusion paper, one challenge noted was that without sufficient surrounding structure, designed active sites were sometimes left exposed on the surface or completely buried with no access​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
. A larger scaffold could mitigate the “exposed active site” failure mode by providing enough protein to form pocket walls. (Conversely, it could also risk the “overly buried” scenario if not careful, but the hope is that a larger protein finds a balanced configuration where the triad is partially buried in a concave pocket – the ideal case​
PMC.NCBI.NLM.NIH.GOV
.)

Trade-offs: Designing significantly longer proteins (say 400+ residues) can be more difficult. The sampling space grows, and it may be harder for the model to converge on a well-folded solution. There’s a risk of generating disordered tails or extra domains that don’t pack well. To control this, one might specify a range (like 180-200) rather than an indefinite increase, so that the model doesn’t stray into unrealistically large structures. Another consideration is that a larger protein might be harder to express or less soluble in practice, but at the design stage the focus is on structural hypothesis testing (stability vs pocket formation). If the hypothesis is correct, extending the design window could produce designs where the catalytic site is more completely surrounded by structured elements (potentially improving catalytic efficiency by positioning additional binding residues). If it’s wrong or unnecessary, RFdiffusion might just create a bigger protein without clear benefit, or struggle to fold it.

Summary: Extending the contig lengths gives the model more canvas to paint on. It’s akin to saying “maybe our enzyme needs to be bigger, like natural enzymes X, Y, Z which have ~400 amino acids for this activity.” The expected outcome is a more robust scaffold – for example, extra helices or sheets that further stabilize the triad or form a lid over it. This is a direct mapping of a design hypothesis (bigger scaffold = better enzyme) to a contig change.

2. Shifting the Design Region (Altering Motif Position in Sequence)
Hypothesis: “Perhaps the active site should be positioned differently within the protein (e.g., closer to one terminus or at a domain interface) for optimal function.” Shifting the design region means adjusting how much of the protein is built on each side of the motif, effectively moving the motif’s position along the sequence.

How to modify: If we wanted the motif closer to the N-terminus, we might reduce the N-segment and extend the C-segment, e.g. [50-50/E210-230/280-300]. This tells RFdiffusion to build a short N-terminal tail of ~50 residues before the motif and a much longer C-terminal region of ~280–300 after. Conversely, to place the motif nearer the C-terminus, we might do [250-270/E210-230/50-50]. We could also experiment with symmetric vs asymmetric distributions (the original 164/165 is fairly symmetric).

Rationale: In real enzymes, active sites are not always exactly centered in the sequence – sometimes they are closer to one end or even at a domain boundary. For example, many enzymes are composed of multiple domains and the active site lies between them; in such cases, the catalytic residues may reside near the end of one domain (and the beginning of the next). By shifting the motif position in the contig, one can explore different topological placements of the active site:

A N-terminal shifted motif (short N, long C) could emulate an enzyme where the active site is at the interface of a small domain (N-side) and a large domain (C-side). This might create a deeper pocket opening from the N-terminus side. It could also be useful if one envisages fusing this enzyme to something else at the N-terminus (since the N-terminus would be short and perhaps conveniently placed).
A C-terminal shifted motif (long N, short C) might resemble enzymes where the C-terminus forms only a capping loop over the active site. For instance, in some proteases, after the histidine there’s only a short loop before the chain ends, with the bulk of the structure before the histidine. Shifting in this way could test if a smaller C-terminal “lid” is sufficient.
Expected effects: Shifting the motif will change the fold topology that RFdiffusion produces. With a long C-terminal segment, the model might create a large C-terminal domain that packs against a smaller N-terminal region, potentially yielding an asymmetric protein. With the motif near the edge of that interface, the active site could become more solvent-accessible on one side (which might be good for substrate entry). On the other hand, if the motif is too close to a terminus, one must watch out for flexibility – for example, if only 50 residues remain after the motif, the C-terminus might need to be well-structured or secured by disulfides or metal ions in real designs to not flap open. RFdiffusion, however, will try to fold even that short tail into a stable arrangement if possible.

Real-world design insight: A researcher might shift the design if they have a hypothesis about how the substrate will approach the active site. Say the substrate is large and one side of the pocket should be open – placing the motif closer to one end of the protein could naturally leave one side less obstructed. Alternatively, one might discover that designs with the motif dead-center were too symmetric or burying the site too deeply, so shifting could encourage a more open configuration. Another scenario is if you plan a fusion enzyme or a multi-domain assembly – you might deliberately put the active site near an end so it can sit at an interface with another domain (though that may involve chain breaks or separate contigs for multiple chains).

Caution: When shifting, ensure that the shorter segment is still long enough to fold into a coherent structure. For instance, specifying only 10 residues on one side of the motif would almost certainly be too short for a stable fold (unless you intend that end to maybe form a short helix that docks onto a larger portion, which is advanced). The examples above still keep the shorter side ~50 residues, which is roughly the lower bound for a small stable domain (like a small α/β domain or a couple of helices that pack). Also, one must consider that RFdiffusion doesn’t “know” to treat the two sides as separate domains unless a chain break is introduced. In our shifted examples, it will make one continuous chain – but the large disparity in lengths could implicitly lead to a two-domain architecture (with one domain much larger). This is actually fine, as many enzymes have one large and one small domain clamping together.

Summary: Shifting the motif position in the contig allows testing of different architecture hypotheses – essentially “where should the active site live within the protein?”. It translates to adjusting the numeric values in the contig before/after the slash. The expectation is that RFdiffusion will scaffold the motif in a new context (more skewed to one end), which can change pocket geometry and accessibility. This is a practical way to explore designs that mimic different natural arrangements (for example, having the active site at a domain junction vs. dead center in a single domain).

3. Expanding or Constraining the Selection Range (Length and Segment Choices)
Hypothesis: “We’re not entirely sure about the optimal lengths – let’s allow some flexibility (or tighten it up) to see what works best.” This strategy acknowledges uncertainty in how big each segment should be and leverages RFdiffusion’s ability to sample variable lengths. It can also involve changing how much of the motif we include (expanding or narrowing the anchor).

Length range sampling: Instead of fixed 164 and 165, one can specify ranges. For example, 150-180/E210-230/150-180 would tell the model to randomly choose a length between 150 and 180 for each flanking region on each design run​
GITHUB.COM
. This introduces flexibility: some designs might end up total length ~321, others ~360, etc. The hypothesis here is “maybe we don’t need exactly 164, maybe anything in this range could form a viable scaffold – let’s see what the model comes up with.” In practice, this can reveal whether a slightly smaller scaffold might still work or if a slightly larger one folds better. If the model consistently outputs structures at the higher end of the range that look good (and shorter ones look poor or have motif distortions), that’s evidence that indeed a larger scaffold is favorable. Conversely, if even the shorter ones (closer to 150) still manage to form a solid pocket, one might opt for the more minimal design for efficiency.

Constraining ranges: After some sampling, a researcher might find that, say, anything below 160 residues N-terminally led to unstable motifs. In that case, one could tighten the range or fix a length at 164 or higher. Constraining could also mean locking the lengths to exact values after initially exploring a range, to reduce variability once you identify a “sweet spot.” For instance, if 170 worked best, you might then fix 170-170 for subsequent focused designs. This iterative adjustment reflects the experimental mindset: start broad to explore, then narrow down to refine.

Expanding/narrowing the motif segment: Similar logic applies to the motif itself. One might try anchoring a bit more of the original structure if they suspect additional conserved residues around the triad are important (expanding the selection). For example, maybe positions 208–209 and 231–232 (just outside the original 210–230 window) also form part of the active site (say, a glycine at 208 helps loop conformation, or a tryptophan at 232 helps stabilize the His via packing). Including those by changing to E208-232 would constrain the design more (less freedom for RFdiffusion to invent that part, it will import those residues too). The hypothesis there is “the broader active-site environment is important, not just the triad.” Indeed, in enzyme active sites, often a constellation of nearby residues (second-shell residues) are important for fine-tuning activity​
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG
. By expanding the anchor, you preserve those as well. The expected effect is a design that looks more like the original enzyme around the active site (likely high success in maintaining geometry, since you’ve given the model even more pre-organized structure to work with). The cost is reduced novelty — you are closer to just duplicating the known protein’s pocket.

Conversely, narrowing the motif (say using E214-226 to only keep the His-Asp and maybe not the Ser if one dared) would give the model more freedom (it would have to build the Ser loop itself). This is generally harder – you’re removing constraints and hoping the model can fill in the gap. The effect could be lower success rate or more variability in how the catalytic residues end up positioned. You would only do this if you have a hypothesis that perhaps the original loop around Ser210 wasn’t ideal and a new loop could be even better, or if you want to test the model’s ability to innovate a solution. It’s a risky move because the triad geometry could drift without the full set of anchors. For important functional residues, completely constraining them (as in the base case 210–230) is usually safer. However, one might try a slight narrowing if one of those anchored residues is causing a design problem (for example, perhaps a proline in the anchor makes it hard for the model to connect, so you drop it and let diffusion try another kink).

Influence on RFdiffusion outputs: Using length ranges will yield outputs of varying sizes and possibly different topological solutions. One run might produce a compact single-domain protein of 320 amino acids; another run with the upper end might produce a domain with a long tail or a two-domain architecture. The diversity increases. You might discover novel folds this way – RFdiffusion could, for instance, generate a TIM-barrel-like scaffold in one case vs. a helical bundle in another, all while accommodating the motif. By examining which ones satisfy your functional and stability criteria (e.g., the triad still well-formed, good AlphaFold confidence, etc.), you can glean insights. If all the successful designs cluster around a certain length or style, that guides your next steps (you’d constrain towards that cluster).

Real-world practicality: In laboratory enzyme design, one often doesn’t know the “perfect” scaffold size. You might try designing several proteins of different lengths or folds and test them experimentally. Here, RFdiffusion can automate some of that exploration via ranges. It keeps the process practical by letting the model attempt many possibilities quickly. The contig specification is directly encoding the experiment: e.g., “let’s sample scaffolds with N-terminal length anywhere from 150 to 180, to see if shorter ones can still hold the motif.” If shorter ones fail to fold or mis-position the motif, that tells you those residues were probably needed – essentially confirming the hypothesis that a large scaffold is necessary.

Constrained ranges for reproducibility: Once you have evidence (say from analysis or an initial diffusion run) that a specific length works best, you might constrain the range to that exact number to reduce noise in subsequent designs. This yields more consistent outputs that you can then focus on optimizing (like sequence refinement, etc.). So, contig ranges allow a dial-up or dial-down approach to exploration: broad for discovery, narrow for exploitation.

Summary: Expanding or constraining the selection range in the contig is a way to directly encode uncertainty or certainty in your design parameters. It’s about answering questions like “How long should the scaffolding regions be?” or “Should I include more of the native motif or let the AI fill it in?” in a systematic way. By observing RFdiffusion’s results under these different settings, a researcher can converge on an effective design. It’s a powerful mapping of hypothesis to generation: uncertain elements are given flexibility (ranges), whereas confirmed necessary elements are locked in (fixed values). For example, if unsure of length – allow a range; if unsure of which residues to include – try both including and excluding and compare. This strategy mirrors scientific experimentation, but here it’s done in silico via the contig parameters.

Practical Takeaway: Each part of the contig string corresponds to a piece of the protein design that a researcher has thought carefully about. The numbers (like 164 or 165) come from hypotheses about how much protein is needed to support the active site based on real enzymes. The inclusion of a specific segment (E210-230) comes from identifying a catalytic motif that should be preserved. Modifying the contig is akin to tweaking the experimental design – making the protein bigger or smaller, moving the active site, or altering the catalytic residues – to test new ideas. In RFdiffusion, these choices strongly influence what structures are generated, so a clear mapping from hypothesis to contig leads to a focused design campaign. By grounding these decisions in enzyme biochemistry (e.g. knowing that active sites are small and need lots of support​

, or that catalytic residues are conserved and must be precisely arranged​

), the researcher ensures that the contigs they use will produce proteins that make sense chemically and structurally, not just mathematically. The contig 164-164/E210-230/165-165 is one such carefully crafted specification, and the reasoning we’ve detailed shows how real-world knowledge is translated into the language of RFdiffusion to achieve successful enzyme designs.
