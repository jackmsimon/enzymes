# Test-Time Program Search for RFdiffusion Enzyme Design

This project aims to discover novel enzyme scaffolds around fixed catalytic motifs—particularly the **Ser–His–Asp** triad—using an **AlphaGo-inspired program search** combined with **automated web research**. It automates the end-to-end process from gathering relevant literature and insights to generating multiple RFdiffusion design scripts, each preserving the catalytic residues but varying the surrounding scaffold.
